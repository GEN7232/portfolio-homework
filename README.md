The link to my web page is https://gen7232.github.io/portfolio-homework/

In this assignment I had to make a portfolio that had clickable links and a responsive layout. My portfolio includes placeholder images for now, and they all link to Google as I do not have much to show just yet. I have a fixed header and footer, so they stay at the top and bottom of the screen respectively as the user scrolls. I have links in the navigation bar to go to my github, as well as the portfolio secontion of my page and a contact me area. I have several containers that display flex and their children have different flex sizes. To make my webpage responsive I made it so font sizes, image widths, and margins changed as the page was made smaller. My background is also a blue gradient that I think gives it a more modern look.
